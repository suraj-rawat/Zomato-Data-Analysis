## Overview
Zomato is an Indian online food ordering and delivery platform that connects customers with restaurants across various cities. By analyzing the Zomato dataset, we aim to uncover insights into customer behavior, restaurant performance, popular cuisines, and delivery trends to understand the business operations better. 

The dataset contains tables like `food`,`orders`, `users`, `restaurant`, and `menu`, providing valuable data points such as user information, sales, order trends, and restaurant performance.

## Dataset

The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset:

## Data Exploration with SQL

While exploring the Swiggy dataset, the following tasks were undertaken:

1. Inspecting the Dataset
   - Verified table structures, column names, and data types.
   - Examined primary and foreign key relationships, such as `user_id`, `r_id`, and `order_date`.
   - Checked for missing values, duplicate entries, and inconsistencies in key attributes.

2. Data Cleaning
   - Removed duplicate entries in tables like `orders` and `users`.
   - Corrected spelling inconsistencies in city names and restaurant names.
   - Ensured consistency in categorical data such as cuisines and customer segments.

3. Data Enrichment
   - Created derived columns like `spending_category`, `order_day`, and `cuisine_rank`.
   - Merged datasets to integrate details about restaurants, users, and menu items.

4. Summary Statistics
   - Calculated aggregate statistics such as average delivery time, total orders per user, and total sales by restaurant.

5. Rolling Counts and Trends
   - Used SQL window functions to compute rolling averages and growth metrics over time for sales and customer activity.
